Here is a summary of all the significant progress we have made on your project so far:

Project Status Summary

Data Layer (DataFetcher):

We have successfully created a flexible DataFetcher that can pull historical data from two different providers: TradingView and Angel One.
The data source is easily configurable in config/settings.yaml, allowing you to switch between providers without changing any code.
We have addressed the provider-specific API requirements, handling TradingView's n_bars parameter and Angel One's date-range-based requests to provide a consistent output.

Authentication (AngelOneExecutor & Helpers):

We have built a helper script, examples/generate_angelone_token.py, to correctly handle the Angel One SmartAPI authentication flow.
The system correctly uses your MPIN and TOTP to generate the daily access_token and refresh_token, aligning with Angel One's latest security policies.
The AngelOneExecutor is set up to use these tokens, and while it currently simulates trades, it's ready for real API integration.

Analysis Module (indicators.py):

Your analysis module is robust and well-tested.
It contains functions to calculate three key technical indicators: RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
We have created a comprehensive unit test suite for this module using pytest, and all tests are currently passing, ensuring the calculations are reliable.

Core Logic (TradingStrategy & LiveTrader):

We have architected the system to separate pure strategy logic from live operations.
The TradingStrategy class contains the core decision-making logic (currently a confluence of RSI and Bollinger Bands) and is fully configurable from settings.yaml.
The LiveTrader class orchestrates the live trading process, connecting the data fetcher, strategy, and trade executor.

Backtesting Engine (BacktestingEngine):

We have built a functional, event-driven backtesting engine.
It successfully simulates your trading strategy over historical data, iterating bar-by-bar.
It calculates and prints a detailed performance report, including Total Return, PnL, Win Rate, Max Drawdown, and an annualized Sharpe Ratio.
It generates an equity_curve.png plot to visualize portfolio performance over time.

Project Structure & Usability:

The project has a clean, professional src layout that separates concerns.
A main entry point, src/main.py, allows you to run the system in either live or backtest mode using simple command-line arguments.
The backtesting mode is flexible, allowing you to specify which stocks and time intervals to test via the command line.
A .gitignore file is in place to protect your credentials and keep the repository clean.
We were in the middle of adding a feature to plot trade entry and exit points on the price chart when you encountered the truncation issue. The very first step for that was to refactor the trade logging to use structured data (dictionaries) instead of simple strings.

Let's pick up right from there.
